# anime-search
An open-source search engine for all things anime.
AnimeSearch is down currently due to operating costs, but it is being rebuilt using a more robust tech stack www.animesearch.app

# Tech stack
- Python, Flask
- HTML/CSS

# Backend
This project is built using my search-recommend-engine created form scratch (https://github.com/haosenli/search-recommend-engine)

# Frontend
Currently, the front-end is a basic interface written in pure HTML/CSS. The new version will be using Next.js.
